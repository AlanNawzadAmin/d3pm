# Minimal Implementation of a D3PM (Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces), in pytorch

Here is a minimal implementation of a D3PM (Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces) in pytorch. This is a simple implementation of the model, and is not optimized for performance. The code is based on the paper [Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03006). I have tried to keep the code as simple as possible, so that it is easy to understand. As far as I know, this is the first, faithful reimplementation of D3PM in pytorch. (Please correct me if I am wrong)
